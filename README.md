# **"YouTube Data Lakehouse and Analysis"**

I embark on an exciting journey into the field of data exploration with my project, "YouTube Data Lakehouse and Analysis." Streamlit application was developed to allows users to Extract data from multiple YouTube channels. The application will have features to input a YouTube channel ID, retrieve all the relevant data using YouTube API and Load the data in a MongoDB database as a Data Lake. The data from different YouTube channels were Transformed from the data lake to a MySQL Warehouse in a structured fprm for dynamic and engaging Exploratory Data Analysis.

**Key Features:**
* **Extract:**  Comprehensive data including Channels, Playlists, Videos, and Comments using YouTube API.
* **Load:** Efficient loading and management of YouTube data in Data Lake architecture using MongoDB.
* **Transform:** Seamless data transformation to MySQL Data Warehouse.
* **Analysis:** Deployment of Streamlit app for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualization of YouTube channel data from Data Lakehouse architecture.
